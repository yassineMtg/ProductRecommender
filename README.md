### Business Case Description

Addressing the challenge of product discovery in e-commerce, this system aims to personalize the shopping experience, leading to increased user engagement, higher conversion rates, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Business Value of Using ML

By incorporating ML, the system:
- Enhances the relevance of product recommendations.
- Drives revenue through increased purchase rates.
- Fosters customer loyalty by improving the shopping experience.

## Data Requirements

### Nature and Sources

Utilizes user-item interaction data from e-commerce platforms, including preferences, browsing history, and feedback.

### Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for model training and evaluation.

## Metrics for Business Goal Evaluation

- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the recommendations.
- **Recall**: Assesses the system's ability to identify all relevant items.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive metric of system performance.

### Rationale

These metrics are chosen to align with the goal of delivering precise and comprehensive product recommendations to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

## Baselines

### Current System

The platform currently uses basic algorithms and manual searches for product recommendations.

### Objectives

Our goal is to surpass these methods by improving precision, recall, and F1 scores, thereby offering superior recommendations.

## Getting Started

To start using the Product Recommendation System, follow the setup instructions detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
