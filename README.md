## Getting Started

To understand the project's inception and goals, read through the sections below.

## ML Problem Specification

### Business Case Description

The Product Recommendation System addresses the need for personalized product recommendations in an e-commerce setting. Users often face challenges in discovering products suited to their preferences among a vast array of options. This system aims to enhance user experience by providing tailored recommendations based on historical interactions.

### Business Value of Using ML

Implementing machine learning in the recommendation system brings significant value to the business. The system aims to increase user engagement, boost conversion rates, and improve overall customer satisfaction. By leveraging ML, we can provide users with relevant product suggestions, ultimately driving revenue and customer loyalty.

## Data Requirements

### Data Nature

The system relies on user-item interaction data, including user preferences, browsing history, and explicit feedback.

### Data Sources

Data will be sourced from e-commerce platform logs, capturing user interactions and product details.

### Data Preprocessing

The data will undergo preprocessing steps to handle missing values, perform normalization, and encode categorical variables.

## Metrics for Business Goal Evaluation

### Key Metrics

- **Precision:** The accuracy of product recommendations.
- **Recall:** The ability to capture all relevant products.
- **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall.

### Rationale

These metrics align with our business goals of providing accurate and comprehensive recommendations to users.

## Baselines

### Existing Systems

Currently, the platform relies on manual search and basic recommendation algorithms.

### Benchmarks

We aim to outperform existing systems by achieving higher precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on running the system, making predictions, and interacting with the recommendation engine can be found in the [Usage](#usage) section.
